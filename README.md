## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app is an inventory management app. The goals of this app were to provide a tool that would help users to easily manage and keep track of their inventory. The app was designed to address the user needs to be able to organize their inventory, modify inventory items, and be alerted when an item has gone out of stock.  

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The home screen that displays the list of inventory items and their information in a way that is simple to understand was necessary for users to easily visualize their inventory. Features like clearly labeled headers, and clearly labeled buttons that allow users to edit, add, or delete items, helps users to easily understand how to navigate through that screen to complete their desired tasks. The Out-of-Stock screen shows the user a separate list of items that have reached zero in quantity. This helps the user to identify items that are out of stock easier. The Settings screen is where a user can choose whether or not they want to be sent notifications when an item goes out of stock. The bottom navigation bar is also clearly labeled and allows users to easily navigate to these three different screens.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

For coding my app, I first began with coding the layout for the different screens and ensuring that I had incorporated all of the major features I intended the app to have. Then I worked on the functionality of each screen individually. I have learned from this project that for future projects, I will be more wary of how I’m going to incorporate a database into my program’s functionality.  

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ensured my code was functional by running my code through an emulator. This process let me see where I needed to modify my code, and easier identify which parts of my code were not working the way I needed them to. 

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The biggest challenge for me was working with a database shell. I had to really think about how the code was interacting with the database and how I could actually get the app to display the database information. Through a lot of research, I was able to figure it all out.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think I was particularly successful in creating a working navigation bar menu. Features like navigation menus are really useful, and I’m glad I was able to create one for my app.
